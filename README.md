## Technical Documentation
Products are used from the Open Food Facts Project - [Link](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/)

It is free and open to use database under the Open Database License (OBDL) - [More information](https://wiki.openfoodfacts.org/Reusing_Open_Food_Facts_Data)

Products for this project are contained to only Canada and the United States instead of the full database set provided by Open Food Facts. This includes roughly 83760 canadian products within a MongoDB database, with a fetch and creation time of up 1.5 hours. The United States has about 612118 products, with estimates of 20 hours to create. See the dbFetch.js file for implementation of this process.
